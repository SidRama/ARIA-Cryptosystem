# ARIA-Cryptosystem

This is an implementation of the ARIA block cipher which was selected by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards as a standard cryptographic technique. Follow the link for furthur details: http://210.104.33.10/ARIA/index-e.html

This implementation requires the Boost Library.

TODO:
1. Implementation for 192 bit and 256 bit keys.
2. Code optimization.

Note:
The key and cipher text must be entered in hexadecimal (eg: 0x123 must be entered as 123). The plain text must be entered as regular alphanumeric characters. 
Each character is represented using 8 bits.
